<p>Very disappointed with meal - bland , overcooked , poor quality meat and very small serves. Rice was gluggy ! Used to go here regularly few years ago and was nice but not now, can not recommend this place now. Service could be more professional also,orders were mixed up. Better value and quality for price elsewhere. Will not return.</p>

<p class="center">Lorm Thai is the definition of Thai food. When you enter the venue you are instantly immersed within the Thai culture. The star highlight was the service. Extremely elegant and accommodating with a beautiful smile. The food was also delicious. Personally my Pad Thai was wonderfully fragrant with a party of flavours working in conjunction to create art. For any of you who somehow have room left for dessert, the mango lassi was phenomenal. A final thing to note was the abundance but yet precise amount of ice that perfected my coke. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
